, Draconids Meteor Shower, 2030/10/07, 2030/10/08, The Draconids is a minor meteor shower producing only about 10  meteors per hour. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet 21P  Giacobini-Zinner\ which was first discovered in 1900. The Draconids is an  unusual shower in that the best viewing is in the early evening instead o f early morning like most other showers. The shower runs annually from Oct ober 6-10 and peaks this year on the the night of the 7th. Unfortunately t he glare from the nearly full moon will block most of the meteors this yea r. Combined with the low hourly rate it would probably be best to skip thi s one unless you are really patient. Best viewing will be in the early eve ning from a dark location far away from city lights. Meteors will radiate  from the constellation Draco\ but can appear anywhere in the sky.
, Full Moon, 2030/10/11, 2030/10/12, The Moon will be located on the opposite side of the Earth as  the Sun and its face will be will be fully illuminated. This phase occurs  at 10:46 UTC.

Meteors will radiate from t he constellation Orion\ but can appear anywhere in the sky.
, New Moon, 2030/10/26, 2030/10/27, The Moon will located on the same side of the Earth as the Sun  and will not be visible in the night sky. This phase occurs at 20:17 UTC.

The second stream is produced by debris left behind by Come t 2P Encke. The shower runs annually from September 7 to December 10. It p eaks this year on the the night of November 4. The waxing gibbous moon wil l block most of the fainter meteors in the evening. But it will set a few  hours after midnight leaving dark skies for what could be a good early mor ning show. Best viewing will be just after midnight from a dark location f ar away from city lights. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Taur us\ but can appear anywhere in the sky.

This shower is unique in that it has a cyclonic peak  about every 33 years where hundreds of meteors per hour can be seen. That  last of these occurred in 2001. The Leonids is produced by dust grains le ft behind by comet Tempel-Tuttle\ which was discovered in 1865. The showe r runs annually from November 6-30. It peaks this year on the night of the  17th and morning of the 18th. The second quarter moon will block some of  the fainter meteors this year.

This is the best time of the month to observe faint objects such as galax ies and star clusters because there is no moonlight to interfere.
, Total Solar Eclipse, 2030/11/25, 2030/11/26, A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon completely blocks t he Sun\ revealing the Sun's beautiful outer atmosphere known as the coron a.

It  will them move out into the Indian Ocean and across southeast Australia. A  partial eclipse will be visible throughout southern Africa\ the southern  Indian Ocean\ parts of Indonesia\ and most of Australia and Antarctica. \n        () ()

, Geminids Meteor Shower, 2030/12/13, 2030/12/15, The Geminids is the  king of the meteor showers. It is conside red by many to be the best shower in the heavens\ producing up to 120 mul ticolored meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by debris left behi nd by an asteroid known as 3200 Phaethon\ which was discovered in 1982. T he shower runs annually from December 7-17. It peaks this year on the nigh t of the 13th and morning of the 14th. The glare from the waning gibbous m oon will obscure many of the fainter meteors this year. But the Geminids a re so bright and numerous that this could still be a good show. Best viewi ng will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from  the constellation Gemini\ but can appear anywhere in the sky.
, December Solstice, 2030/12/21, 2030/12/22, The December solstice occurs at 20:12 UTC.

This is the first day of winter (wint er solstice) in the Northern Hemisphere and the first day of summer (summe r solstice) in the Southern Hemisphere.
, Ursids Meteor Shower, 2030/12/21, 2030/12/23, The Ursids is a minor meteor shower producing about 5-10 meteo rs per hour.

Meteors will radiate from the constellation Ursa Minor\ but  can appear anywhere in the sky.
